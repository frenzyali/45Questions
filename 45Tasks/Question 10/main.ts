// Question 10: Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least 
// one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are 
// too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program 
// file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.




// Comment for Program 3: This program takes the value in the variable and converts it to lowercase, uppercase and titlecase by using the following code
let Name = "Ali Hussain";
console.log(Name.toLowerCase());
console.log(Name.toUpperCase());
console.log(Name[0].toUpperCase()+Name[1]+Name[2] + " " + Name[4].toUpperCase()+Name[5]+Name[6]+Name[7]+Name[8]+Name[9]+Name[10]);

// Comment for Program 5: This program takes two values and prints them with the name of the Author and their quote with proper punctuation.
let AuthorName = "Sun Tzu";
let Quote = "In order to know your enemy, you must become your enemy";
console.log(AuthorName + ' once said,' + ' "' + Quote + '."');
