// Question 45: Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept 
// an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and 
// two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object that’s 
// returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
