// Question 42: Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. 
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the 
// phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has 
// actually been modified.
